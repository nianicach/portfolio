## 1. What I aspect to learn?    
Bioinformatics has always been an interesting topic for me to study. This is a fairly new direction in science and often the terms of definition of what it is 
in my head get mixed up with statistics and data science. I would like to finally understand what tools and languages are used in bioinformatics, to explore a new 
perspective on data processing and working with them. And also find out what career paths are possible for bioinformatics.
